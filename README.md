# Newtons-Cannonball
Newton's cannonball was a thought experiment Isaac Newton used to hypothesize that the force of gravity was universal...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball

The cannon fires a ball that falls to earth.
The cannon adds some power to the next shot and the cannonball goes a bit farther.
Eventually the ball flies with enough velocity to break the planets gravity and falls into orbit.
The ball litterally falls around the planet indefinetly.

I built this in Game Maker in like 2002...ish but, of course I didn't need to do the math as gravity was built in.

I am not a Mathologer by any means but, I did want to figure it out for myself and after some research and fiddling I was able.

### TODO

I want to make this look better. I simply wrote the code to get the concept working without much thought about aesthetics.
